### dynamicdata

#### Concept

Retrieves dynamic data from a server, and normalizes it for use on a page.
This is intended to be used in conjunction with a background job that processes
data from a server, and regularly writes it to a JSON file to keep the content
in the file updated with the dynamic data source.

This supports two modes, `staging` and `prod`. In `staging`, the system
supports previewing values that may exist at some point in the future, by using
keys `start_date` and `end_date`.

In conjunction with a query parameter, the end user can preview values at
different dates.

If a `staging` key is not provided for a file, it will not be available.
`staging` keys are intended to be omitted from production HTML/JS and should
only be included for staging environments.

#### Example scenarios

For example, let's say you wanted to manage a promo schedule in a Google Sheet.
This utility could be used to schedule promos (with one promo per row in the
sheet). In `prod`, only the currently active promo would be rendered. In
`staging`, the user could use a query parameter (`?ak-now=2019/04/16` for
example) to render the content and preview it at different stages.

#### Sample usage

```markdown
# Sample data (i.e. in a Google Sheet).

| id | start_date | end_date | title |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| birthday | 2019-01-06 00:00 | 2019-01-07 00:00 | Jamie's birthday |
| birthday | 2019-04-16 00:00 | 2019-04-17 00:00 | Jennifer's birthday |
| birthday | 2019-09-27 00:00 | 2019-09-28 00:00 | Julie's birthday |
| color | | 2019-04-01 | purple |
| color | 2019-04-01 | 2019-08-01 | red |
| color | 2019-08-01 | | blue |
```
